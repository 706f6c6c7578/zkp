ZKP - Zero Knowledge Proof. Let Bob prove to Alice that he knows the value of x.

This may be useful if they both meet at a Café and agree on a prime and integer.
Once done, Bob enters both values and his secret integer. When Bob is on holidays,
Alice can ask Bob for a proof and if the value of x is correct, Alice knows that
she is communicating with Bob.
